# Finances API API

The **Finances API** retrieves a variety of seller transactional information, including the following:

*   Seller payouts for orders
*   Detailed information on other transaction types, including eBay shipping label purchases, buyer refunds, seller credits, and listing-related fees
*   Complete list of selling fees and credits during a specified date range
*   A detailed breakdown of order earnings and seller expenses for orders

## API Information

**Title:** Finances API
**Version:** v1.19.0
**Description:** This API is used to retrieve seller payouts and monetary transaction details related to those payouts.
**Base Path:** /sell/finances/v1

## API Methods

The following API methods are available:

### getOrderEarnings

#### GET /order_earnings
**Description:** This method returns detailed order-level financial data for each order associated with a seller account. The returned order-level financial data includes order earnings, gross amount, expenses, and refunds. Order earnings includes earnings after deducting expenses and refunds from the gross amount.  

**Note:** Expenses include fees, shipping labels, and donations. Refunds include gross refunds, gross claims, and gross payment disputes.

The financial data for orders will be returned as filtered based on the order's creation date.

**Note:** Only charges and credits tied to the order are shown, and they appear in near real time for orders created within the selected order creation time window.

Pagination is supported through the `limit` and `offset` parameters. These parameters can be used to control the number of records returned in a single response and to retrieve subsequent pages of results when the result set spans multiple pages.  
  
The response can be filtered by using the `filter` parameter. This parameter allows consumers to restrict the results returned by the method based on supported filtering criteria.  

**Note:** Access to the **order\_earnings** resource is currently limited to only US, China, or Hong Kong sellers who meet the following criteria and also request access:  
  
\- US sellers with the country of residence set to `US` and having a payout currency in `USD`.  
  
\- Hong Kong or China sellers having the country of residence set to `HK` or `CN` and the payout currency set to `USD` have access.  
  
To request access, submit an [application growth check](/api-docs/static/gs_request-an-application-growth.html) to have the required [OAuth scope](#h3-oauth-scope) added to your app. After submission, you can use the same [growth check](/api-docs/static/gs_request-an-application-growth.html) link to track the status of the request.  
  
eBay plans on expanding this to other markets in the future.

  

**Important!** Due to EU & UK Payments regulatory requirements, an additional security verification via Digital Signatures is required for certain API calls that are made on behalf of EU/UK sellers, including all Finances API methods. Please refer to [Digital Signatures for APIs](/develop/guides/digital-signatures-for-apis) to learn more on the impacted APIs and the process to create signatures to be included in the HTTP payload.

  

**Note:** The Finances API does not support [Team Access](https://www.ebay.com/sellercenter/ebay-for-business/multi-user-account-access). Financial information, such as payouts or transactions, is only returned for the user that makes the call. You cannot use any of the methods in this API to return financial information for another user.
**Parameters:**
- **X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID** (string) *required*
  - This header identifies the seller's eBay marketplace.  
  
See [Request Headers](/develop/api/sell/request_headers#marketplace-id-values) for the marketplace ID values.  
  
**Note:** If a marketplace ID value is not provided, the default value of `EBAY_US` is used.
- **filter** (string)
  - This parameter can be used to filter orders created within a specified date range. The filter uses the `orderCreationDate` field, which works similarly to the `transactionDate` filter used by the Transactions API. Currently, `orderCreationDate` is the only supported filter value.

**Note:** All dates must be input using UTC format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ`) and should be adjusted accordingly for the local timezone of the user.

**Default**: If no value is specified, results from the past year will be returned.
- **limit** (string)
  - This parameter configures the number of orders to return per page of the result set. Use this parameter in conjunction with the **offset** parameter to control the pagination of the output.  
  
For example, if **offset** is set to `10` and **limit** is set to `10`, the method retrieves orders 11 thru 20 from the result set.  
  
**Note:** This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first page in the results set has an offset value of `0`.  
**Maximum:** `200`  
**Default:** `20`
- **offset** (string)
  - This parameter can be used to specify the number of records to skip before returning results. This parameter is commonly used with the `limit` parameter to retrieve the next page of results.  
  
**Maximum:** 10,000  
**Default:** 0
- **sort** (string)
  - This parameter can be used to specify the sort order of the results. Currently, sorting is supported by order creation date.  
  
**Default:** Results returned in ascending order sorted by **orderCreationDate**, with earliest creation date first.
**OAuth scope**

This request requires an access token created with the **Client Credentials Grant** flow, using one or more scopes from the following list (please check your Application Keys page for a list of OAuth scopes available to your application):

### getOrderEarningsById

#### GET /order_earnings/{order_id}
**Description:** This method returns detailed order-level financial data including order earnings, gross amount, expenses, and refunds. Order earnings includes earnings after deducting expenses and refunds from the gross amount.  

**Note:** Expenses include fees, shipping labels, and donations. Refunds include gross refunds, gross claims, and gross payment disputes.

**Note:** Only charges and credits tied to the order are shown, and they appear in near real time for orders created within the selected order creation time window.

The response returns earnings information only for the order identified by the `order_id` path parameter.  

**Note:** Access to the **order\_earnings** resource is currently limited to only US, China, or Hong Kong sellers who meet the following criteria and also request access:

Please refer to [Digital Signatures for APIs](</develop/guides/digital-signatures-for-apis >) to learn more on the impacted APIs and the process to create signatures to be included in the HTTP payload.

  
**Note:** The **Finances API** does not support [Team Access](https://www.ebay.com/sellercenter/ebay-for-business/multi-user-account-access). Financial information, such as payouts or transactions, is only returned for the user that makes the call. You cannot use any of the methods in this API to return financial information for another user.  
This method retrieves details on a specific seller payout. The unique identifier of the payout is passed in as a path parameter at the end of the call URI.  
  
The **getPayouts** method can be used to retrieve the unique identifier of a payout, or the user can check Seller Hub.  
  
For split-payout cases, which are **only** available to sellers in mainland China, this method will return the **payoutPercentage** for the specified payout. This value indicates the current payout percentage allocated to a payment instrument. This method will also return the **convertedToCurrency** and **convertedToValue** response fields in CNY value.  
  
**Note:** In split-payout cases, this method will only return details on an individual payout, also known as a true(actual) payoutid. If a user inputs a **payoutReference** id as a path parameter, the call will fail and the **404 not found** status code will be returned.  
For more information on split payouts, see [Mainland China Split Payout Playbook](/api-docs/split-payout/playbook.html).  
This method returns mock data in the sandbox environment.
**Parameters:**
- **X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID** (string) *required*
  - This header identifies the seller's eBay marketplace.  
  
See [Request Headers](</develop/api/sell/request_headers#marketplace-id-values >) for the marketplace ID values.

### getPayouts

#### GET /payout
**Description:** **Important!** Due to EU & UK Payments regulatory requirements, an additional security verification via Digital Signatures is required for certain API calls that are made on behalf of EU/UK sellers, including all **Finances API** methods. Please refer to [Digital Signatures for APIs](</develop/guides/digital-signatures-for-apis >) to learn more on the impacted APIs and the process to create signatures to be included in the HTTP payload.

  
**Note:** The **Finances API** does not support [Team Access](https://www.ebay.com/sellercenter/ebay-for-business/multi-user-account-access). Financial information, such as payouts or transactions, is only returned for the user that makes the call. You cannot use any of the methods in this API to return financial information for another user.  
This method is used to retrieve the details of one or more seller payouts. By using the **filter** query parameter, users can retrieve payouts processed within a specific date range, and/or they can retrieve payouts in a specific state.  
  
**Note:** Only payouts less than 5 years in the past can be retrieved.  
There are also pagination and sort query parameters that allow users to control the payouts that are returned in the response.  
  
If no payouts match the input criteria, an empty payload is returned.  
  
For split-payout cases, which are **only** available to sellers in mainland China, this method will return the **payoutPercentage** for the specified payout. This value indicates the current payout percentage allocated to a payout instrument. This method will also return the **convertedToCurrency** and **convertedTo** response fields set to CNY value and the **payoutReference**, the unique identifier reference (not true payout).  
  
By using the **filter** query parameter, users can retrieve the two true(actual) payouts associated with a **payoutReference**.  
  
**Note:** For more information on split payouts, see [Mainland China Split Payout Playbook](/api-docs/split-payout/playbook.html).  
This method returns mock data in the sandbox environment.
**Parameters:**
- **X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID** (string) *required*
  - This header identifies the seller's eBay marketplace.  
  
See [Request Headers](</develop/api/sell/request_headers#marketplace-id-values >) for the marketplace ID values.  
  
**Note:** If a marketplace ID value is not provided, the default value of `EBAY_US` is used.
- **filter** (string)
  - The filter types that can be used here are discussed below. If none of these filters are used, all payouts in all states from within the last five years are returned:  

*   **payoutDate**: search for payouts within a specific range of dates. The date format to use is `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ`. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a date range:  
      
    `https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/payout?filter=payoutDate:[2024-12-17T00:00:01.000Z..2024-12-24T00:00:01.000Z]`  
      
    Only payouts from the last five years can be retrieved, so make sure the starting date is less than five years in the past from the present time. Also, the maximum date range that can be specified through this date filter is 36 months, so make sure your specified date range is no more than 36 months.
*   **lastAttemptedPayoutDate**: search for attempted payouts that failed within a specific range of dates. In order to use this filter, the **payoutStatus** filter must also be used and its value must be set to `RETRYABLE_FAILED`. The date format to use is `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ`. The same syntax and requirements applicable to the **payoutDate** filter also apply to the **lastAttemptedPayoutDate** filter.  
      
    This filter is only applicable (and will return results) if one or more seller payouts have failed, but are retryable.
*   **payoutStatus**: search for payouts in a particular state. Only one payout state can be specified with this filter. For supported **payoutStatus** values, see [PayoutStatusEnum](/develop/api/sell/finances_api#sell-finances_api-payout-getpayouts.payoutstatusenum).  
      
    Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by payout status:  
      
    `https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/payout?filter=payoutStatus:{SUCCEEDED}`
*   **payoutReference**: returns the two true (actual) payouts associated with the payoutReference id. This parameter can support up to 200 **payoutReference** inputs. This filter is **only** supported for mainland China sellers. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific **payoutReference**:  
      
    `https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/payout?filter=payoutReference:{5********3}`

  
If both the **payoutDate** and **payoutStatus** filters are used, payouts must satisfy both criteria to be returned.
- **limit** (string)
  - The number of payouts to return per page of the result set. Use this parameter in conjunction with the **offset** parameter to control the pagination of the output.  
  
For example, if **offset** is set to `10` and **limit** is set to `10`, the method retrieves payouts 11 thru 20 from the result set.  
  
**Note:** This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first payout in the results set has an offset value of `0`.  
  
**Maximum:** `200`  
**Default:** `20`
- **offset** (string)
  - This integer value indicates the actual position that the first payout returned on the current page has in the results set. So, if you wanted to view the 11th payout of the result set, you would set the **offset** value in the request to `10`.  
  
In the request, you can use the **offset** parameter in conjunction with the **limit** parameter to control the pagination of the output. For example, if **offset** is set to `30` and **limit** is set to `10`, the method retrieves payouts 31 thru 40 from the resulting collection of payouts.  
  
To avoid poor response time, use **offset** values of less than `5000`.  
  
**Note:** This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first payout in the results set has an offset value of `0`.  
  
**Default:** `0` (zero)
- **sort** (string)
  - By default, payouts or failed payouts that match the input criteria are sorted in descending order according to the payout date/last attempted payout date (i.e., most recent payouts returned first).  
  
To view payouts in ascending order instead (i.e., oldest payouts/attempted payouts first,) you would include the **sort** query parameter, and then set the value of its **field** parameter to `payoutDate` or `lastAttemptedPayoutDate` (if searching for failed, retryable payouts). Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a payout date range in ascending order:  
  
`https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/payout?filter=payoutDate:[2018-12-17T00:00:01.000Z..2018-12-24T00:00:01.000Z]&sort=payoutDate`  
  
Payouts can only be sorted according to payout date, and can not be sorted by payout status.

Financial information, such as payouts or transactions, is only returned for the user that makes the call. You cannot use any of the methods in this API to return financial information for another user.  
This method is used to retrieve cumulative values for payouts in a particular state, or all states. The metadata in the response includes total payouts, the total number of monetary transactions (sales, refunds, credits) associated with those payouts, and the total dollar value of all payouts.  
  
**Note:** Only payouts less than 5 years in the past can be retrieved.  
If the **filter** query parameter is used to filter by payout status, only one payout status value may be used. If the **filter** query parameter is not used to filter by a specific payout status, cumulative values for payouts in all states are returned.  
  
The user can also use the **filter** query parameter to specify a date range, and then only payouts that were processed within that date range are considered.  
  
This method returns mock data in the sandbox environment.
**Parameters:**
- **X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID** (string) *required*
  - This header identifies the seller's eBay marketplace.

  - The two filter types that can be used here are discussed below. One or both of these filter types can be used. If none of these filters are used, the data returned in the response will reflect all payouts in all states that have occurred within the last five years:  

*   **payoutDate**: consider payouts processed within a specific range of dates. The date format to use is `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ`. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a date range:  
      
    `https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/payout_summary?filter=payoutDate:[2024-12-17T00:00:01.000Z..2024-12-24T00:00:01.000Z]`  
      
    Only payouts from the last five years can be retrieved, so make sure the starting date is less than five years in the past from the present time. Also, the maximum date range that can be specified through this date filter is 36 months, so make sure your specified date range is no more than 36 months.
*   **payoutStatus**: consider only the payouts in a particular state. Only one payout state can be specified with this filter. For supported **payoutStatus** values, see [PayoutStatusEnum](/develop/api/sell/finances_api#sell-finances_api-payout-getpayouts.payoutstatusenum).  
      
    Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by payout status:  
      
    `https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/payout_summary?filter=payoutStatus:{SUCCEEDED}`

  
If both the **payoutDate** and **payoutStatus** filters are used, only the payouts that satisfy both criteria are considered in the results.

Pagination and sort query parameters are also provided that allow users to further control how monetary transactions are displayed in the response.  
  
If no monetary transactions match the input criteria, an http status code of _204 No Content_ is returned with no response payload.  
  
**Note:** Only monetary transactions that have occurred within the last five years can be retrieved.
**Parameters:**
- **X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID** (string) *required*
  - This header identifies the seller's eBay marketplace.  
  
See [Request Headers](</develop/api/sell/request_headers#marketplace-id-values >) for the marketplace ID values.  
  
**Note:** If a marketplace ID value is not provided, the default value of `EBAY_US` is used.
- **filter** (string)
  - Numerous filters are available for the **getTransactions** method, and these filters are discussed below. One or more of these filter types can be used. If none of these filters are used, all monetary transactions occurring within the last five years are returned:

*   **transactionDate**: search for monetary transactions that occurred within a specific range of dates.  
      
    **Note:** All dates must be input using UTC format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ`) and should be adjusted accordingly for the local timezone of the user.  
    Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a date range:  
      
    `https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=transactionDate:[2024-10-23T00:00:01.000Z..2024-11-09T00:00:01.000Z]`  
      
    Only payouts from the last five years can be retrieved, so make sure the starting date is less than five years in the past from the present time. Also, the maximum date range that can be specified through this date filter is 36 months, so make sure your specified date range is no more than 36 months.
*   **transactionType**: search for a specific type of monetary transaction. For supported **transactionType** values, see [TransactionTypeEnum](/develop/api/sell/finances_api#sell-finances_api-transaction-gettransactions.transactiontypeenum).  
      
    Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a monetary transaction type:  
      
    `https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=transactionType:{SALE}`
*   **transactionStatus**: this filter type is only applicable for sales orders, and allows the user to filter seller payouts in a particular state. For supported **transactionStatus** values, see [TransactionStatusEnum](/develop/api/sell/finances_api#sell-finances_api-transaction-gettransactions.transactionstatusenum).  
      
    Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by transaction status:  
      
    `https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=transactionStatus:{PAYOUT}`
*   **buyerUsername**: the eBay username or user ID of the buyer involved in the monetary transaction. Only monetary transactions involving this buyer are returned. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific eBay buyer:  
      
    `https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=buyerUsername:{buyer1234}`
*   **payoutId**: the unique identifier of a seller payout. This value is auto-generated by eBay once the seller payout is set to be processed. Only monetary transactions involving this Payout ID are returned. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific Payout ID:  
      
    `https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=payoutId:{5********8}`
*   **transactionId**: use this field **transactionId** and also **transactionType** to filter for a unique identifier of a monetary transaction, or an error will occur. For a sales order, the **orderId** filter should be used instead. Only the monetary transaction defined by the identifier is returned.  
      
    **Note:** This filter cannot be used alone; the **transactionType** must also be specified when filtering by transaction ID.  
    Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific transaction ID:  
      
    `https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=transactionId:{0*-0***0-3***3}&filter=transactionType:{SALE}`
*   **orderId**: the unique identifier of a sales order. Only monetary transaction(s) associated with this **orderId** value are returned.  
      
    For any other monetary transaction, the **transactionId** filter should be used instead.  
      
    Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific order ID:  
      
    `https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=orderId:{0*-0***0-3***3}`
*   **payoutReference**: returns the monetary transactions associated with the **payoutReference**. By using this ID as a filter parameter, the user will be able to track all monetary transactions associated with both sibling payouts, including sales and refunds, if any. This filter is **only** supported for sellers in Mainland China. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by **payoutReference**:  
      
    `https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=payoutReference:{5*******3}`
- **limit** (string)
  - The number of monetary transactions to return per page of the result set. Use this parameter in conjunction with the **offset** parameter to control the pagination of the output.  
  
For example, if **offset** is set to `10` and **limit** is set to `10`, the method retrieves monetary transactions 11 thru 20 from the result set.  
  
**Note:** This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first item in the list has an offset of `0`.  
  
**Maximum:** `1000`  
**Default:** `20`
- **offset** (string)
  - This integer value indicates the actual position that the first monetary transaction returned on the current page has in the results set. So, if you wanted to view the 11th monetary transaction of the result set, you would set the **offset** value in the request to `10`.  
  
In the request, you can use the **offset** parameter in conjunction with the **limit** parameter to control the pagination of the output. For example, if **offset** is set to `30` and **limit** is set to `10`, the method retrieves transactions 31 thru 40 from the resulting collection of transactions.  
  
To avoid poor response time, use **offset** values of less than `5000`.  
  
**Note:** This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first item in the list has an offset of `0`.  
**Default:** `0` (zero)
- **sort** (string)
  - By default, monetary transactions that match the input criteria are sorted in descending order according to the transaction date (i.e, most recent transactions returned first).  
  
To view transactions in ascending order instead (i.e., oldest transactions first), you would include the **sort** query parameter and set its value to `transactionDate`. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a transaction date range in ascending order:  
  
`https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=transactionDate:[2023-10-01T00:00:01.000Z..2023-10-12T00:00:01.000Z]&sort=transactionDate`  
  
Transactions can only be sorted according to transaction date.

### getBillingActivities

#### GET /billing_activity
**Description:** **Important!** Due to EU & UK Payments regulatory requirements, an additional security verification via Digital Signatures is required for certain API calls that are made on behalf of EU/UK sellers, including all **Finances API** methods. Please refer to [Digital Signatures for APIs](</develop/guides/digital-signatures-for-apis >) to learn more on the impacted APIs and the process to create signatures to be included in the HTTP payload.

  
**Note:** The **Finances API** does not support [Team Access](https://www.ebay.com/sellercenter/ebay-for-business/multi-user-account-access). Financial information, such as payouts or transactions, is only returned for the user that makes the call. You cannot use any of the methods in this API to return financial information for another user.  
This method retrieves filtered billing activities of the seller. Returned results are filtered through query parameters such as date range, activity ID, listing ID, or order ID. Sorting and pagination features help organize and navigate returned activities efficiently.
**Parameters:**
- **Accept-Language** (string)
  - This header indicates the natural language and locale preferred by the user for the response.  
  
For more information, see the **Accept-Language** header in [Request Headers](/develop/api/sell/request_headers) and [Marketplace ID values](/develop/api/sell/request_headers#marketplace-id-values). If not provided, defaults to `en-US`.

  - This required field specifies which results to return in the response. Only one of the following four filter values must be used. A user can either retrieve all billing activity within a date range, or they can retrieve billing activity related to a specific eBay order, eBay listing, or they can retrieve information on a specific billing activity.  

*   **activityId**: If this filter is used, only information on a specific billing activity is returned. The [billingTransactionId](/develop/api/sell/finances_api#sell-finances_api-billing_activity-getbillingactivities.billingactivitylineitem.billingtransactionid) returned in the response can be used as the **activityId**.
*   **listingId**: If this filter is used, only billing activity associated with the specified listing is returned.
*   **orderId**: If this filter is used, only billing activity associated with the specified order is returned.
*   **transactionDate**: If a date range filter is used, only billing activity that occurred within the specified date range is returned. The starting date cannot be set back further than 120 days in the past. Use UTC date values in the following order: `[_start_.._end_]`

  
**Examples**  
  
IDs:  
`filter=activityID:{12**56}`  
  
Date range:  
`filter=transactionDate:[2025-10-01T00:00:00Z..2025-10-31T23:59:59Z]`
- **limit** (string)
  - Sets the maximum number of records to return per page of data.  

Use this parameter in conjunction with the **offset** parameter to control the pagination of the output. For example, with offset set to `20` and limit set to `10`, the call retrieves entries 21 through 30 from the result set.

Although this field is optional, if omitted the default value of `100` is used.

  
**Minimum:** `1`  
**Maximum:** `200`  
**Default:** `100`
- **offset** (string)
  - Specifies the number of records to skip in the result set. This is used with the `limit` field to control the pagination of the output. For example:  

*   If **offset** is `0` and **limit** is `10`, the method will retrieve records 1-10 from the list of records returned
*   If **offset** is `10` and **limit** is `10`, the method will retrieve records 11-20 from the list of records returned.

If this parameter is not set, its value defaults to `0` which returns the first page of records.

**Note:** This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first activity in the list has an offset of 0.

**Default:** `0` (zero, returns the first page)
- **sort** (string)
  - By default, transactions that match the input criteria are sorted in descending order according to the transaction date (most recent transactions returned first).  
  
To view transactions in ascending order instead (oldest transactions first), include the **sort** query parameter and set its value to `sort=transactionDate`. For example (ascending order):  
  
`filter=transactionDate:[2025-11-01T00:00:01.000Z..2025-11-12T00:00:01.000Z]&sort=transactionDate`  
  
Transactions can only be sorted according to transaction date. If omitted, defaults to descending order (most recent transactions returned first).

### Transactions
**Description:** This is the base response type of the **getTransactions** method. The **getTransactions** response includes details on one or more monetary transactions that match the input criteria, as well as pagination data.
**Type:** object

**Properties:**
- **href** (string)
  - The URI of the **getTransactions** method request that produced the current page of the result set.
- **limit** (integer)
  - The maximum number of monetary transactions that may be returned per page of the result set. The **limit** value can be passed in as a query parameter, or if omitted, its value defaults to `20`.  
  
**Note:** If this is the last or only page of the result set, the page may contain fewer monetary transactions than the **limit** value. To determine the number of pages in a result set, divide the **total** value (total number of monetary transactions matching input criteria) by this **limit** value, and then round up to the next integer. For example, if the **total** value was `120` (120 total monetary transactions) and the **limit** value was `50` (show 50 monetary transactions per page), the total number of pages in the result set is three, so the seller would have to make three separate **getTransactions** calls to view all monetary transactions matching the input criteria.  
  
**Maximum:** `200`  
**Default:** `20`
- **next** (string)
  - The **getTransactions** method URI to use if you wish to view the next page of the result set.  
  
This field is only returned if there is a next page of results to view based on the current input criteria.
- **offset** (integer)
  - This integer value indicates the actual position that the first monetary transaction returned on the current page has in the results set. So, if you wanted to view the 11th monetary transaction of the result set, you would set the **offset** value in the request to `10`.  
  
In the request, you can use the **offset** parameter in conjunction with the **limit** parameter to control the pagination of the output. For example, if **offset** is set to `30` and **limit** is set to `10`, the method retrieves monetary transactions 31 thru 40 from the resulting collection of monetary transactions.  
  
**Note:** This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first item in the list has an offset of `0`.  
  
**Default:** `0` (zero)
- **prev** (string)
  - The **getTransactions** method URI to use if you wish to view the previous page of the result set.  
  
This field is only returned if there is a previous page of results to view based on the current input criteria.

  - An array of one or more monetary transactions that match the input criteria. Details for each monetary transaction may include the unique identifier of the order associated with the monetary transaction, the status of the transaction, the amount of the order, the order's buyer, and the unique identifier of the payout (if a payout has been initiated/issued for the order).
